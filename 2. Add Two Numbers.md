# Add Two Numbers

## Problem Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Solution

Below is a Python solution that adds two numbers represented as linked lists:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution(object):
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        """
        :type l1: Optional[ListNode]
        :type l2: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        # Initialize the dummy head for the ListNode
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy
        carry = 0

        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0
            # 342 + 465 = 807, 3+4, 4+6, 2+5
            # 3+4+0=7, 4+6+0=10, 2+5+1=8
            total = val1 + val2 + carry
            carry = total // 10
            current.next = ListNode(total % 10)
            current = current.next
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None

        return dummy.next
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Create a dummy node to simplify the linked list construction. Set `current` to point to the dummy node and initialize `carry` to 0.
2. **Traversal**: Continue while there are digits in either `l1`, `l2`, or a non-zero carry:
   - Extract values from `l1` and `l2` (use 0 if the list is exhausted).
   - Compute the sum (`total`) of the digits plus the carry.
   - Update `carry` as `total // 10` (integer division to get carry-over).
   - Create a new node with `total % 10` (the units digit).
   - Move `current` to the new node and advance `l1` and `l2` if they exist.
3. **Return**: Return `dummy.next`, which is the head of the resulting linked list.

This solution handles all edge cases, including lists of different lengths and cases where a carry propagates to a new digit.
