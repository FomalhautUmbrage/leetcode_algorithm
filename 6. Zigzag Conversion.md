# 📝 Study Notes: Zigzag Conversion (LeetCode #6)

## 🔗 Problem Summary

Given a string `s` and an integer `numRows`, write the string in a zigzag pattern on the given number of rows. Then, read line by line to produce the final string.

## 🧠 Example

**Input:**
```
s = "PAYPALISHIRING"
numRows = 4
```

**Zigzag pattern:**
```
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P
```

**Output:**
```
"PINALSIGYAHRPI"
```

## 🔧 Core Idea

Simulate the process of writing characters **row by row** in a zigzag fashion:

- Move **down** row by row until you reach the bottom.
- Then move **up** until you reach the top.
- Repeat this process.

## ✅ Key Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
        if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):
            return s

        rows = [''] * numRows
        current_row = 0
        direction = -1

        for c in s:
            rows[current_row] += c
            if current_row == 0 or current_row == numRows - 1:
                direction *= -1
            current_row += direction

        return ''.join(rows)
```

## 🧩 Common Questions

### ❓ Why do we use `[''] * numRows`?

This creates a list of empty strings, one for each row. We build the zigzag result row by row.

Example:
```python
numRows = 3
rows = ['', '', '']
```

---

### ❓ What is `direction` and why is it multiplied by -1?

We use `direction` to track whether we're going **downward** (`+1`) or **upward** (`-1`).

- At the **top row (0)** or **bottom row (numRows - 1)**, we reverse the direction.
- `direction *= -1` flips between up and down.

---

### ❓ Why check `if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s)`?

Because if:

- There's only **1 row**, the zigzag is just the original string.
- Or if there are **more rows than characters**, the string doesn't need conversion.

Returning early avoids unnecessary computation.

---

### ❓ What does `''.join(rows)` do?

It concatenates all rows into a single string without spaces.

Example:
```python
rows = ['PINAL', 'ALSIG', 'YAHRPI']
''.join(rows)  # Output: 'PINALSIGYAHRPI'
```

## 🔁 Step-by-Step Simulation (First Few Steps)

For `"PAYPALISHIRING"` with `numRows = 4`:

1. `'P'` → row 0 → going down
2. `'A'` → row 1
3. `'Y'` → row 2
4. `'P'` → row 3 → now go **up**
5. `'A'` → row 2
6. `'L'` → row 1
7. `'I'` → row 0 → now go **down** again
