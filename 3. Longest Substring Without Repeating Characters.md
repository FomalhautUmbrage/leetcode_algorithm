# Learning Notes: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Examples**

* Input: `s = "abcabcbb"`
  Output: `3`
  Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc".

* Input: `s = "bbbbb"`
  Output: `1`
  Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "b".

* Input: `s = "pwwkew"`
  Output: `3`
  Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "wke".

## Solution Code

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Hash table to store the last seen index of each character
        last_str = {}
        # Left boundary of the sliding window
        left = 0
        # Record of the maximum length found
        length = 0

        for right, c in enumerate(s):
            # If current character appears in the current window, move left boundary
            if c in last_str and last_str[c] >= left:
                left = last_str[c] + 1
            # Update the last seen index for character c
            last_str[c] = right

            # Calculate the current window length (inclusive)
            current_length = right - left + 1
            # Update the maximum length if needed
            if current_length > length:
                length = current_length

        return length
```

## Key Questions & Answers

**1. Why use `left = last_str[c] + 1` when moving the left boundary?**
`last_str[c]` gives the previous index of character `c`. Setting `left = last_str[c] + 1` ensures the sliding window skips past the old occurrence, removing the duplicate from the window.

**2. Why calculate length as `right - left + 1`?**
`right - left` measures the index difference (number of steps), but to count both endpoints in the substring, you add 1, giving the total number of characters in the window.

**3. Why compare and update `length` with `current_length`?**
`current_length` is the length of the window at the current iteration. We need to keep track of the maximum window size seen throughout the entire traversal, so we update `length` whenever `current_length` exceeds it.
